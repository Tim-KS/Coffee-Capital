![CoffeeCapitalLogoTrm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109460560/201080268-01f186c0-8d4e-481e-a636-fd9e0e281aa3.png)



## Motivation of application development 

Coffee Capital online order application allows the user to place an order ahead at their local coffee shop, so that it is ready for them to collect when they reach. 

A simple application has been created allowing the user to view the available beverages and food items on the menu, which communicates with the database to place an order in real time. 

<!-- Remove the following:

Allow a commuter travelling to work to place an order for their beverage from a coffee shop, so that it is ready at a particular set time for them to collect their order. -->

<!-- Admin - to allow customers to place an order to ahead prior to their arrival - so that the order is ready for they arrive.  -->

## User Story
